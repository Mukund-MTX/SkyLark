Flaws in Iteration 1 are: 
1. If the drone were to drop for a height, the whole would get damaged and will have to be replaced making it cost ineffective. 
2. There isn't enough space for electronics components.

Flaws in Iteration 2 are:
1. There can be more optimisation in weight done.
2. Final analysis isn't complete such as drop test and cfd.
